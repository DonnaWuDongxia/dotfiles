# dotfiles
dotfiles, including my personal favorite system settings across Linux and Mac OS X.

## Installation

Open a terminal window, and run:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jondong/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh -L > bootstrap.sh | sh bootstrap.sh
```

If you have a bash-compatible shell, you can run the script directly:

```
sh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jondong/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh -L)
```
